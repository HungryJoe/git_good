## Texts
* Some texts to help understand (directed, acyclic, unweighted) **graphs** in the CS/graph-theory sense at a conceptual level:
    * [Graphs in Computer Science *Portland State University*](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Doc/Graphs.html) (only through *Kinds of Graphs*)
    * [Explained: Graphs *MIT News*](https://news.mit.edu/2012/explained-graphs-computer-science-1217) (only first couple paragraphs)
    * [Graph (discrete mathematics) *Wikipedia*](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Definitionsttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Definitions) (for the algebraically-minded)
* Some texts to help understand **trees** in the CS/graph-theory sense at a conceptual level:
    * [Tree (data structure) *Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) (only *Intro*, *Terminology*, *Examples of trees and non-trees*, and *Mathematical Terminology*)
